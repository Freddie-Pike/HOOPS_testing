# HWP Demo React MicroEngine

This is a demo for integrating [Hoops Communicator](https://www.techsoft3d.com/products/hoops/communicator/) with React framework.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Install node_module dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
